# Huco - write python Code in any Human language

This project was created and designed by Bassam El-Naggar

## What does it do?
Every programming language that I can think of is written in English. This can be a huge barrier to entry for someone trying to get into programming if their English is not strong. Huco acts as an interpreter between the programmer and the python interpreter. It takes code written in a human language (i.e Arabic, French, German, etc.) and translates it into valid pythonic code. This way, the programmer can write python code in whatever human language makes them most comfortable.

## Dependencies
- Python

## Usage
#### File Tree
The file tree is fairly simple. In the directory in which you are writing code, make sure you have the following files/directories:
- huco.py
- lexer.py
- Hfile
- languages - a directory which includes the language translations
	- `The language files you use are put here`
